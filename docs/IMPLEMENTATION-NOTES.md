# Portfolio implementation notes

## Milestone
Information architecture + design system foundation.

## Visual resource mapping

- **Aceternity UI patterns:** spotlight cards, restrained spotlight hero treatment, bento-style project hierarchy, moving/interactive border language.
- **Canvas UI:** the hero uses a local particle-reveal canvas layer based on the Particle Reveal interaction described by Canvas UI. It is isolated from page content so the HTML remains the source of truth and the effect can be removed for reduced-motion or unsupported devices.
- **VGPU:** the hero includes an optional WebGPU shader field using the `vgpu` runtime and an inline WGSL fullscreen effect. It is dynamically imported, capped to a modest DPR, and fails silently when WebGPU is unavailable.

## Architecture

Content is data-driven in `src/data/portfolio.js`. Visual effects live under `src/components`, while the page composition remains in `src/App.jsx`.

## Content verification

The portfolio uses repository-backed claims plus publicly surfaced LinkedIn facts. Detailed project responsibilities, publication URLs, GitHub project URLs, email and resume are intentionally not fabricated and remain follow-up items if not supplied.

## Deployment

The existing GitHub Pages workflow and Vite `/portfolio/` base path are preserved.
